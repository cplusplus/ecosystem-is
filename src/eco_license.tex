\textbf{Section 2 -- Scope.}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item[a.] \textbf{License grant.}

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item[1.] Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
		the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
		non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
		exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
		
		\begin{enumerate}

			\item[a.] reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
			in part; and

			\item[b.] produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

		\end{enumerate}

		\item[2.] \underline{Exceptions and Limitations}. For the avoidance of
		doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
		License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
		its terms and conditions.

		\item[3.] \underline{Term}. The term of this Public License is specified
		in Section 6(a).

		\item[4.] \underline{Media and formats; technical modifications allowed}.
		The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
		all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
		and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
		Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
		authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
		necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
		technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
		Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
		simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
		(4) never produces Adapted Material.

		\item[5.] \underline{Downstream recipients}.
		
		\begin{enumerate}

			\item[a.] \underline{Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material}.
			Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
			receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
			Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
			Public License.

			\item[b.] \underline{No downstream restrictions}. You may not offer
			or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
			apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
			Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
			Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
			Material.

		\end{enumerate}

		\item[6.] \underline{No endorsement}. Nothing in this Public License
		constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that
		You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
		with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
		the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
		provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

	\end{enumerate}

	\item[b.] \textbf{Other rights.}

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item[1.] Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
		licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
		privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
		the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
		assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
		extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
		Rights, but not otherwise.

		\item[2.] Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
		Public License.

		\item[3.] To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
		collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
		Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
		under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
		licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
		reserves any right to collect such royalties.

	\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Section 3 -- License Conditions.}

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

\begin{enumerate}

	\item[a.] \textbf{Attribution}.

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item[1.] If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
		form), You must:

		\begin{enumerate}

			\item[a.] retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
			with the Licensed Material:

			\begin{enumerate}

				\item[i.] identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
				Material and any others designated to receive
				attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
				the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
				designated);

				\item[ii.] a copyright notice;

				\item[iii.] a notice that refers to this Public License;

				\item[iv.] a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
				warranties;

				\item[v.] a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
				extent reasonably practicable;

			\end{enumerate}

			\item[b.] indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
			retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

			\item[c.] indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
			Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
			hyperlink to, this Public License.

		\end{enumerate}

		\item[2.] You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
		reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
		which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
		reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
		hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
		information.

		\item[3.] If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
		information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
		reasonably practicable.

		\item[4.] If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
		License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
		Material from complying with this Public License.

	\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.}

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item[a.] for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
	to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
	portion of the contents of the database;

	\item[b.] if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
	contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
	Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
	Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

	\item[c.] You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
	all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

\end{enumerate}

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


\textbf{Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item[a.] UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
	EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
	AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
	ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
	IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
	ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
	KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
	ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

	\item[b.] TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
	TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
	INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
	COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
	USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
	ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
	DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
	IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

	\item[c.] The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
	above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
	possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
	waiver of all liability.

\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Section 6 -- Term and Termination.}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item[a.] This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
	Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
	this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
	terminate automatically.

	\item[b.] Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
	Section 6(a), it reinstates:

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item[1.] automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
			it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
			violation; or

		\item[2.] upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

	\end{enumerate}

	For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
	right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
	of this Public License.

	\item[c.] For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
	Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
	distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
	will not terminate this Public License.

	\item[d.] Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
	License.

\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item[a.] The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
	terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

	\item[b.] Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
	Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
	independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Section 8 -- Interpretation.}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item[a.] For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
	shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
	conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
	be made without permission under this Public License.

	\item[b.] To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
	deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
	minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
	cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
	without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
	conditions.

	\item[c.] No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
	failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
	Licensor.

	\item[d.] Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
	as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
	that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
	processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
